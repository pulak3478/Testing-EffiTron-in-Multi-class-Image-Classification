# 🚀 EffiTron: Eye Disease Classification Using EfficientNet + Transformer

This repository contains the implementation of **EffiTron**, a deep learning model that combines the EfficientNet backbone with Transformer encoder blocks to classify eye diseases into four classes:

- Cataract  
- Diabetic Retinopathy  
- Glaucoma  
- Normal  

The model is trained and evaluated on the Kaggle Eye Disease Dataset, with comprehensive performance analysis and visualization.
